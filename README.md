# Moving Face
This is my first gameboy game, I am working on more features (obviously I'm not gonna be keeping the project like this)
# Compiling
First, you must have extracted the GBDK zip in C:\
Then run the following command in Command Prompt: `make.bat` Or in pwsh (powershell) `.\make.bat`
You should see a file named "main.gb" if you see it, success! You compiled the game.
# Running
If you have an emulator, simply load the ROM file into the emulator and it should work properly
If you have an actual gameboy, use a flash cartridge to load the game onto the gameboy."# moving-face"
